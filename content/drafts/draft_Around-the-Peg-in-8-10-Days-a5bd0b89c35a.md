In the AMA yesterday we promised a more thorough analysis of our current thoughts on the economics of the protocol. Posting here as there was lots of chatter today on the economics of the protocol. 

1.  Flush near completion: The market has settled down significantly, and with the exception of one more large tranche of LP at Season 1135, there is minimal recent Withdrawal activity. The Seed/Stalk system has resulted in > 50% of LP and > 80% of Beans remaining in the Silo. This is great. The pump and dumpers have been largely weeded out from the system. We are thrilled with the high rate of retention. The longer you remain in the Silo, the higher the opportunity cost to leave, so there is reason to believe the Withdrawals are near an end for this cycle. As the Weather continues to rise we expect another influx of demand to return the price back to its peg. 
2.  2\. Efficient Soil: As of now, it appears that the Soil market was a) relatively efficient and b) largely driven by the FIFO harvest schedule. 

*   a. The returns for being in the Silo during the last growth cycle were about 500%, not including SOP rewards. During the first debt cycle, the first real demand for Soil started at about a 360% return (P = .42, W = 52) and 750k Pods in the line. Currently there are 3.5M Pods and the return is 245% (P = .62, W = 114). It is reasonable to assume that this round of demand for Pods will start after 360% given that there is a longer Pod Line. 
*   b. The FIFO schedule clearly incentivized a large inflow of demand for Soil as once there was some demand for Soil at 360% total return there was a rush of demand that drove P back over $1. As that run of demand slowed down, a new wave of Withdrawals became Claimable and brought price back to .80 — .85. When it became clear there were no more buyers at 233% w 3.4M Pods (P = .77, W = 81) the Weather began to quickly ascend again to find a new optimal rate. Because the price has held up more than yesterday (which is great), it makes sense the Weather must rise more to approach the required total return necessary to attract for demand for Soil. 

  

3\. First cycle: This is the normal and expected volatility and behavior of the system given the massive inflow of capital over the past week. The market has been surprisingly efficient for the first major growth and debt cycles with most participants are still learning the ropes. 

4\. Optimal debt: The current debt level is just around the optimal debt level (15%) and continuing to rise as we approach the end of the first major debt cycle of the protocol. Because Beanstalk is > 15% Weather now, it is acting more agressively with its Weather adjustments. This is appropriate behavior, and the timing of it crossing over optimal debt level serves as a good indication that the debt levels are approximately accurately set. 

5\. Settiling into first equilibrium state: As the price returns to its peg, the system will have entered its first equilibrium at around $1. As the system demonstrates utility by oscillating over $1, there will be a new wave of demand. Until that wave enters, the system will continue to cycle through Pods and reward Silo members during Seasons where P > 1. The Weather will continue to rise until the debt level is below optimal. The System will start to more closely reflect the underlying organic supply and demand for Beans. 

Some of the things we are considering tweaking in the mechanism for the future: 

1.  Lowering Seasons of Rain from 24 to 8 or 12 before a SOP. This would reduce the extent of growth cycles in the future. However, given that a 20x in market cap and 8x in supply in 24 Seasons is very unlikely to happen again, this may not be necessary. 
2.  2\. Adjusting rate of Weather adjustment: The Weather could have responded faster to the situation described above in number 2. However, similar to the SOP timer debate, this may purely be a function of the magnitude of the volatility in the first cycle. We will continue to monitor the system to consider whether changing from a +/- 3 to a \* 103/.97 adjustment style may be reasonable.

  

Some things the community has discussed we are firmly opposed to: 

1.  A tax for selling below $1 on Uniswap: Let’s be clear on the goal of Beanstalk. The goal is to be the decentralized backbone stablecoin of DeFi. The Beanstalk oracle uses the BEAN:ETH Uniswap pool for pricing data. In a world where Beans are traded on a variety of exchanges, a tax would a) make the oracle less accurate and b) do nothing to prevent selling the coin on the other exchanges. This is a bad idea and will hurt Beanstalk. 
2.  2\. A portion of SOPs are retained to buy when P < 1: Similar to above, in a world where derivatives on Beans are widely traded, this type of model can be manipulated and the system can be easily drained of its ETH. We would not support any sort of algorithmic ETH purchases by the protocol. 

  

Some things we are unsure of how we feel, but are interesting: 

1.  Treasury: There seems to a lot of demand from the community for a treasury. We are generally opposed as we feel most protocol treasuries are inefficient uses of capital and prefer funding specific projects through a BIP. However, given the demand from the community, we are open to it. 
2.  2\. Marketing organization: There has been discussion of the necessity of an organized community effort to spread the word. Similar to treasury point, we would prefer to fund with specific proposals, but appreciate the point that a consistently funded effort may be better suited to the task. We will also try to edit these a bit and post on Medium in the next few days. We are so excited to continue working closely with the community improve Beanstalk. This is just the beginning. Publius
