The BeaNFT Genesis Edition event is currently live and anyone can participate to win a BeaNFT through the website [bean.money](https://bean.money).

In the previous post we mentioned the rules for the [BeaNFT Genesis Edition event and launch](https://medium.com/@BeanstalkFarms/the-beanft-genesis-edition-ee6fdadc9124) but we will reiterate a few of the important points.

TheBeaNFT Genesis Edition is a series of up to 6000 Bean NFTs which can only be minted by participating in Beanstalk.

#### Rules

*   Beginning from Season 1200, there will be up to 10 BeaNFTs minted every Season for the next 600 Seasons
*   During the event, the top 10 largest Sows or Deposits each season will be awarded one BeaNFT depending on the price
*   If the price is _below_ 1 during the Season, the top 10 largest Sows will receive one BeaNFT 
*   If the price is _above_ 1 during the Season, the top 10 largest Deposits will receive one BeaNFT
*   There can be less than 10 BeaNFTs minted each Season if the transactions do not meet the qualifications specified above
*   **From the 10 largest transactions, the rarity of the BeaNFT will be issued according to the order of the transactions within the Season (first gets the rarest).**

### Rarity

The different rarities of BeaNFT will be based on a few factors. At mint, the rarity of each BeaNFT will be based on:

*   **Season:** The lower the Season number, the more rarity points.
*   **Time since Sunrise:** The earlier in each Season, the more rarity points.
*   **Size of Sow:** The more beans Sown, the more rarity points.
*   **TWAP Price:** The farther the price from the peg, the more rarity points.
*   **Previous Sow:** If the account had previously sown before Season 1200 they will receive a rarity boost on all of their BeaNFT mints.

#### Extra Details

The BeaNFT Genesis Edition takes into account the state of Beanstalk associated with the participants transaction. This results in BeaNFTs that have unique characteristics different than any other NFT. In addition to the traits stored and used to randomize the BeaNFTs, the BeaNFTs will store the Weather at the time of the transaction.

**Utility:**

*   Access to the Bean Farmers NFT Club .
