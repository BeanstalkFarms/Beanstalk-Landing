Beanstalk managed the sell-off through its credit facility, the Field, and [Conversions](https://twitter.com/BeanstalkFarms/status/1559720270641782789?s=20&t=hDCvHnnL88eapIFUgAezwA) within the Silo. The Field continued to attract strong demand for Soil, issuing ~80M Pods at a high Pod Rate, further underscoring Beanstalk’s strong credit.
