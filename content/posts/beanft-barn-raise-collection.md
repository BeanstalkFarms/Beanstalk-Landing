Beanstalk Farms is excited to announce the BeaNFT Barn Raise Collection. The BeaNFT Barn Raise Collection is a series of up to 10,000 BeaNFTs that can only be rewarded by participating in the Barn Raise prior to Replant. The Replant will be executed by the [Beanstalk Community Multisig](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bcm-process) as soon as possible after [BIP-21](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/72) passes—you can read more about the anticipated Replant timeline [here](https://bean.money/blog/anticipated-replant-timeline).

BeaNFTs were the first project built on top of Beanstalk and with the passage of [BFP-72](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xb87854d7f6f40f0877a1333028eab829b213fbcce03f16f9dd3832c8a98ab99b), they continue to grow and proliferate via the BeaNFT Barn Raise Collection. The previous two BeaNFT collections can both be found on OpenSea ([Genesis](https://opensea.io/collection/beanft-genesis) and [Winter](https://opensea.io/collection/beanft-winter)).

Today, we are excited to share details about the BeaNFT Barn Raise Collection.

**Qualifying for a Barn Raise BeaNFT**

The first 10,000 purchases of at least 1,000 Fertilizer in a single transaction **before** [Replant](https://bean.money/blog/anticipated-replant-timeline) qualify for a Barn Raise BeaNFT. As of writing, about ~360 transactions have qualified for a Barn Raise BeaNFT.

**Issuance**

Similar to existing BeaNFTs, the Barn Raise BeaNFTs will be ERC-721 tokens. Purchasers of Fertlizer already have the ERC-1155 Fertilizer token. In the future, qualifying purchasers will be able to mint associated ERC-721 Barn Raise BeaNFTs. Exact timing on minting is TBA.

**Attributes**

Like the Winter Collection, the Barn Raise BeaNFT design maintains the iconic BeaNFT silhouette with updated attributes that reflect the Beanstalk ethos broadly (farming-oriented and approachable) and the Barn Raise specifically (resolute, heroic and hard-working).

As a result, attribute categories remain largely the same as past BeaNFT collections in terms of body types, outfits, facial features, and hand items.

**Rarity**

Similar to the previous collections, the BeaNFT Barn Raise Collection will involve rarity boosts. Rarity boosts are given for:

1. Earlier participation in the Barn Raise;
2. Existing BeaNFT holders; and
3. Larger amounts of Fertilizer purchased in one transaction.

 **Additional details**

_Decentralized_: Similar to previous collections, the collection of on-chain data for the Barn Raise BeaNFTs will happen in a decentralized fashion. After Replant, on-chain data will be used to calculate rarity boosts to distribute Barn Raise BeaNFTs.

_Viewing/Minting_: The Season after which Barn Raise BeaNFTs can be viewed and minted on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) is TBA.

_Fair Launch_: No Barn Raise BeaNFTs have been pre-minted or pre-allocated. The only way to earn a Barn Raise BeaNFT is by participating in the Barn Raise before Replant.
