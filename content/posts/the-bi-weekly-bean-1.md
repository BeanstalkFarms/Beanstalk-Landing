Welcome to the Bi-Weekly Bean, a newsletter where recap Beanstalk’s highlights from the past two weeks. This issue covers 3/01/22–3/15/22.

What is Beanstalk? Beanstalk is a decentralized credit-based stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Learn more at [bean.money](bean.money)

## **Protocol Summary**

The price of BEAN has remained tightly pegged over the last two weeks, with a maximum single-Season TWAP deviation of -$0.026. In the past week, price has remained mostly above peg, resulting in 1,268,099 newly-minted Beans since the beginning of March.

The recent increased demand for Bean is reflected in Beanstalk’s Pod Rate - the ratio of Unharvestable Pods to total Beans - which has begun to soften, and the protocol’s overall liquidity, which began kicking up materially on March 14th.

Weather reversed its upward trend around March 11th as a result of BIP-13’s commitment. The BIP adjusted Weather Changes so that when demand for Soil is decreasing and P > 1, Weather does not change.
