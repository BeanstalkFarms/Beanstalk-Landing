> What is Beanstalk? Beanstalk is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Learn more at [bean.money](https://bean.money/).

[BOP-1](https://app.bean.money/#/governance/0x0d9e422bafaee7f87744c09afe9c2c68af590fc76d8afd13b12b9dfc9328e794) – the ratification of the Disclosures Statement – has been passed by a vote of the DAO.

Beanstalk is an experiment. The Beanstalk DAO endeavors to be as transparent as possible, particularly as it pertains to communicating the risks of interacting with Beanstalk.

As the Beanstalk community knows, an educated set of Farmers puts the protocol in the best position to succeed. The DAO ratifying these disclosures is another step in that direction.

The Disclosures can be found on **[Arweave](https://arweave.net/g1fij0syFvuxNR83I2VKOe1auNxtjEUwevkihxoRUXg)** or in the **[Farmers' Almanac](https://docs.bean.money/disclosures)**.
