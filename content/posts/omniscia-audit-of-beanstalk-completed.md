Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased to announce that Omniscia - a decentralized smart contract auditing firm - has completed a formal audit of Beanstalk’s core smart contracts through BIP-7.

\*     \*     \*     \*

Prior to the completion of Omniscia’s process, Beanstalk was unaudited. In Q4 2021, the Beanstalk community concluded that contracting a high-quality auditor would help facilitate further growth of the protocol, increase user adoption and reinforce its legitimacy within the broader DeFi community. Omniscia is a premier firm in the smart contract auditing industry and a relevant choice to audit Beanstalk given their [prior track record](https://omniscia.io/index.html#clients) auditing ERC-2535 Diamonds.

On December 3, 2021 the Beanstalk DAO approved and committed BIP-5, leveraging the “Fundraiser” process originally created in [BIP-4](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-4.md). 

Omniscia completed its audit on April 2, 2022, identifying 8 findings using statistical analysis and 68 findings during the manual review. All 76 findings were promptly alleviated prior to the release of the audit report, with Omniscia ultimately concluding that “the codebase of the Beanstalk team can be considered of a very high standard and no outstanding issues remain within the codebase”.
