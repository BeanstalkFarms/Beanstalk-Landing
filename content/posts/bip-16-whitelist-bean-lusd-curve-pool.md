Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased to announce that [BIP-16](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/66), which whitelists LP Tokens for the BEAN:LUSD Curve stableswap liquidity pool for Deposit into the Silo, has been passed by an on-chain vote of the Beanstalk DAO. 

**BEAN:LUSD Curve Pool Overview**

The BEAN:LUSD Curve pool was launched on March 24, 2022 and currently holds over $500,000 in BEAN and LUSD. 

BIP-16 adds LP Tokens for the BEAN:LUSD Curve pool to the Silo whitelist for 1 Stalk and 3 Seeds per flash-loan-resistant Bean denominated value (BDV) Deposited. 

The inclusion of LP Tokens for the BEAN:LUSD Curve pool in the Silo whitelist is mutually beneficial to both Beanstalk and Liquity, as will be the case for future pools with other assets thanks to the positive carry of Beans Deposited in the Silo. The Stalk System is designed to incentivize long-term liquidity that further stabilizes the prices of both BEAN and LUSD over time.

In addition to generating yield, BIP-16 also offers LUSD holders the opportunity to participate in Beanstalk governance, providing additional utility to the LUSD token.
