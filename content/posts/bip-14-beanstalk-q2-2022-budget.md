Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased to announce that [BIP-14](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/61), the Beanstalk Farms Q2 2022 Budget, has been passed by an on-chain vote of the Beanstalk DAO. 

**Beanstalk Farms**

Beanstalk Farms is a decentralized development team supporting Beanstalk. The organization is collectively focused on fulfilling three major ongoing objectives:

* *Decentralized Development* - A diverse organization without any single point of failure or dependence.
* *Scale* - Grow the team to roughly 60 dependable core contributors, which we estimate will provide the protocol with ample full-stack support.
* *Seamless Onboarding and Accountable Work Streams* - Maintain an onboarding process that empowers new contributors to quickly get up to speed and produce at a high level.

**BIP-14 Overview**

BIP-14 funds Beanstalk Farms through Q2 2022, allocating 2,000,000 newly-minted Beans and 383,209.94 Beans to be rolled over from the remaining Q1 2022 Budget, comprising a total budget allocation of 2,383,209.94 Beans.

Each new Beanstalk Farms contributor will have an individual Snapshot proposal to affirm their role within the organization. Current contributors will only require a Snapshot proposal if their role or pay has significantly changed since Q1, or the entire payment from their previous proposal has been made.
