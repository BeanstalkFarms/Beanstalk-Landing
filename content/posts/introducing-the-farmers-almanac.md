Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased the announce the launch of the [Farmers' Almanac](http://docs.bean.money), a documentation hub containing educational resources about Beanstalk and its ecosystem, in addition to guides for interacting with the Beanstalk UI.

In conjunction with the Beanstalk code base and [whitepaper](https://bean.money/docs/beanstalk.pdf) (Version 2.0.0 coming soon), the Farmers' Almanac serves as a source of truth on Beanstalk mechanics and verbiage. Whereas the whitepaper is a highly granular document that contains comprehensive formulas behind Beanstalk's mechanics, the Farmers' Almanac is intended to be easy approachable to all (_i.e._, non-technical) Farmers. The Farmers' Almanac houses community resources that are out of scope of the whitepaper like the Beanstalk Community Multisig processes.

The Farmers' Almanac, like the whitepaper, is a living document that is updated as Beanstalk grows and evolves.

Please leave your feedback in the **#docs-feedback** channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/beanstalk) and stay tuned for updates in the **#docs-updates** channel. Farmers can also open pull requests directly on the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Farmers-Almanac).
