**Development Updates**

* **[Wells code](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Wells)** is now in final review by various contributors. Wells will create an optimal execution environment for providing liquidity to exchanges. Next steps include the Halborn audit and, ideally, a Code4rena audit before deployment.
