Beanstalk Farms, [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and the [Beanstalk Seraph Committee](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bsc-process) are excited to announce that [BIP-31](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/176), the Beanstalk Farms Q1 2023 Budget, and [BIP-32](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xa23167457ea2be6939f1a296cc14357366d9de995eb0d261bcbcdebf13bad0e8), the implementation of Seraph, have passed by a vote of the DAO. 

## BIP-31: Beanstalk Farms Q1 2023 Budget

Beanstalk Farms is a decentralized development organization supporting Beanstalk, and designed the Q1 2023 budget to enable core contributors to work towards the following goals:
* _Decentralized development:_ continue to develop a diverse organization without any single points of failure or dependence.
* _Focus and flexibility:_ deliver high quality output in a timely fashion, while maintaining the flexibility to fund and support a wide variety of unique opportunities related to Beanstalk.
* _Attracting high quality talent:_ continue to attract and retain high quality talent, which is critical to the success of Beanstalk.

The Q1 budget of 750,000 Beans will allow Beanstalk Farms to focus on fulfilling a number of specific objectives across five primary workstreams: security, on-chain development, middleware development, frontend & design and content, community & marketing. Below is a selection of these objectives, with the full list available [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/176):
* Seek to engage at least one more audit firm to continuously audit Beanstalk in addition to Halborn;
* Implement a generalized permit system within Beanstalk (i.e., Tractor);
* Deploy a BEAN:ETH Well on the Beanstalk-native zero fee AMM;
* Reach feature parity between the Bean and Beanstalk subgraphs and Beanstalk;
* Open source the Beanstalk UI;
* Launch a UI for BEAN:ETH Wells in tandem with its on-chain deployment; and
* Release two new educational videos about Beanstalk.

The introduction of the Audit Fund (initially funded with 250,000 Beans per BIP-31) will allow Beanstalk Farms to continue to retain Halborn and set up various audit competitions like [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/).

## BIP-32: Seraph

Halborn is a team of 100+ award-winning ethical blockchain hackers who focus on securing their clients’ full stack end-to-end. Trusted by Solana, Near, BAYC, Ava Labs and many more. Halborn has completed [various security audits of Beanstalk](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits) and continues to audit BIPs as they are developed.

[Seraph](https://seraph.co/) is a non-custodial blockchain security notary (BSN) powered by Halborn. A BSN is a cybersecurity professional who serves an organization (centralized or decentralized) as a third party witness to the signing of important on-chain actions and is meant to deter fraud and prevent attacks.

BIP-32 protects most of the owner functions in Beanstalk with Seraph and forms the Beanstalk Seraph Committee (BSC), the group that has discretion over Runbooks for Seraph-protected functions and removing Seraph in cases where it must be removed for the security or censorship resistance of Beanstalk.

With Seraph, Beanstalk can deter additional attacks on the protocol and disincentivize attackers by making it more difficult and costly to conduct an attack. The fee for Seraph (10,000 USDC per month) is substantially lower than the projected operational and reputational costs associated with an additional attack. By activating Seraph, Beanstalk assets and contracts are protected such that complex attacks may be prevented before they can be executed on-chain.

Implementing Seraph with no other upgrades to Beanstalk governance would make Beanstalk less resistant to censorship. By implementing Seraph and alongside the formation of the BSC, both the BCM and the BSCM must be compromised in order to corrupt Beanstalk, without compromising censorship resistance before on-chain governance is able to be reimplemented.

BIP-32 also implemented various changes to Beanstalk governance, the Beanstalk Community Multisig (BCM) Process, the Beanstalk Immunefi Committee (BIC) Process, the Immunefi Bug Bounty Program and the Beanstalk DAO Disclosures—check out the full list of changes in the[ Arweave upload of BIP-32](https://arweave.net/_k2y8gVEOzDtDEj-dx1PKn5IEtKPL6swkVsUf5kwob0#process-amendments).

**About Beanstalk**

Beanstalk is a decentralized protocol that allows anyone to realize the value of an open, permissionless fiat stablecoin. The Beanstalk community of lenders, borrowers and savers secures a protocol-native stablecoin, Bean, with the goal of creating the world’s most accessible digital money system. By eliminating collateral requirements, Beanstalk can be the catalyst for a trustless money that unlocks the potential of decentralized finance for everyone.
