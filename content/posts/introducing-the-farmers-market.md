Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased to announce the passage and commitment of BIP-11, which creates the *Farmers Market*, a trustless and decentralized marketplace for *Pods*, the Beanstalk-native debt asset.

The *Farmers Market* is part of a broader effort by Beanstalk Farms to increase the utility of Beans, make the Beanstalk ecosystem more liquid, and improve user experience.

Anyone can participate in the *Farmers Market* [here](https://bean.money/market).

The Field
=========

The *Field* is Beanstalk's decentralized credit facility. It offers yield opportunities to creditors for participating in peg maintenance. Anyone can become a Bean Farmer by sowing Beans (lending Beans to Beanstalk). Sown Beans are burned and exchanged for Pods based on the *Weather* (the Beanstalk-native interest rate), which become *Harvestable* (redeemable for Beans 1:1) on a FIFO basis when the Bean supply expands in response to excess demand for Beans.

Prior to the launch of the *Farmers Market*, *Pods* were relatively illiquid assets and could only be traded OTC. These peer-to-peer transactions typically relied on a trusted third party to act as an intermediary, which is not decentralized. The lack of a liquid marketplace for *Pods* also inhibited robust price discovery. Rather than buying and selling *Pods* OTC, users can now buy and sell *Pods* directly through Beanstalk on the *Farmers* *Market*.

Farmers Market Overview
=======================

The *Farmers Market* is the Beanstalk-native marketplace for exchanging *Pods*.

There are two basic primitives within the *Farmers Market*: *Pod Orders* and *Pod Listings*.

Pod Orders
----------

A *Pod Order* is a request to buy *Pods* in exchange for Beans. Each *Pod Order* has three inputs:

1.  The maximum number of *Pods* you want to buy;
2.  The maximum price you are willing pay per *Pod*, denominated in Beans; and
3.  The maximum place in the *Pod Line* from which you are willing to buy *Pods*.

> Example: Farmer Joe wants to buy up to 100 Pods anywhere before 100,000 in the Pod Line for 0.50 Beans / Pod.

To create a *Pod Order*, you must lock the Beans necessary to complete the purchase in the contract.

Instead of waiting for a *Pod Order* to be *Filled*, users can also buy *Pods* directly from an outstanding *Pod Listing*.

Pod Listings
------------

A *Pod Listing* is an offer to sell *Pods* in exchange for Beans. By default, *Pods* are listed from the back of a *Plot*. Each *Pod Listing* takes four inputs:

1.  The *Plot* from which you are willing to sell *Pods*;
2.  The range of *Pods* to be *Listed* from the selected *Plot*;
3.  The minimum price you are willing to receive per *Pod*, denominated in Beans; and
4.  The maximum number of *Pods* that can become *Harvestable* before the *Listing* automatically *Expires*.

> Example: Farmer Joe wants to sell 100 Pods for 0.50 Beans / Pod from the back of their plot at 50,000 in the Pod Line. If the Pod Line moves forward by 10,000 (such that the new place in the Pod Line of Farmer Joe's Pods would be 40,000), the Pod Listing will automatically Expire.

Instead of waiting for a *Pod Listing* to be *Filled*, *Pod* owners can also sell *Pods* directly into an outstanding *Pod Order*.
