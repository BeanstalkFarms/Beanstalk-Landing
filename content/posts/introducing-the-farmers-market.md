Today, Beanstalk Farms is pleased to announce the passage and commitment of BIP-11, which creates the _Farmers Market_, a trustless and decentralized marketplace for _Pods_, the Beanstalk-native debt asset.

The _Farmers Market_ is part of a broader effort by Beanstalk Farms to increase the utility of Beans, make the Beanstalk ecosystem more liquid, and improve user experience.

Anyone can participate in the _Farmers Market_ [here](https://bean.money/market).

## **The Field**

The _Field_ is Beanstalk’s decentralized credit facility. It offers yield opportunities to creditors for participating in peg maintenance. Anyone can become a Bean Farmer by sowing Beans (lending Beans to Beanstalk). Sown Beans are burned and exchanged for Pods based on the _Weather_ (the Beanstalk-native interest rate), which become _Harvestable_ (redeemable for Beans 1:1) on a FIFO basis when the Bean supply expands in response to excess demand for Beans.

Prior to the launch of the _Farmers Market_, _Pods_ were relatively illiquid assets and could only be traded OTC. These peer-to-peer transactions typically relied on a trusted third party to act as an intermediary, which is not decentralized. The lack of a liquid marketplace for _Pods_ also inhibited robust price discovery. Rather than buying and selling _Pods_ OTC, users can now buy and sell _Pods_ directly through Beanstalk on the _Farmers_ _Market_.

## Farmers Market Overview

The _Farmers Market_ is the Beanstalk-native marketplace for exchanging _Pods_.

There are two basic primitives within the _Farmers Market_: _Pod Orders_ and _Pod Listings_.

### _Pod Orders_

A _Pod Order_ is a request to buy _Pods_ in exchange for Beans. Each _Pod Order_ has three inputs:

1.  The maximum number of _Pods_ you want to buy;
2.  The maximum price you are willing pay per _Pod_, denominated in Beans; and
3.  The maximum place in the _Pod Line_ from which you are willing to buy _Pods_.

> _Example: Farmer Joe wants to buy up to 100_ Pods _anywhere before 100,000 in the_ Pod Line _for 0.50 Beans /_ Pod_._

To create a _Pod Order_, you must lock the Beans necessary to complete the purchase in the contract.

Instead of waiting for a _Pod Order_ to be _Filled_, users can also buy _Pods_ directly from an outstanding _Pod Listing_.

### _Pod Listings_

A _Pod Listing_ is an offer to sell _Pods_ in exchange for Beans. By default, _Pods_ are listed from the back of a _Plot_. Each _Pod Listing_ takes four inputs:

1.  The _Plot_ from which you are willing to sell _Pods_;
2.  The range of _Pods_ to be _Listed_ from the selected _Plot_;
3.  The minimum price you are willing to receive per _Pod_, denominated in Beans; and
4.  The maximum number of _Pods_ that can become _Harvestable_ before the _Listing_ automatically _Expires_.

> _Example: Farmer Joe wants to sell 100_ Pods _for 0.50 Beans /_ Pod _from the back of their plot at 50,000 in the_ Pod Line_. If the_ Pod Line _moves forward by 10,000 (such that the new place in the_ Pod Line _of Farmer Joe’s_ Pods _would be 40,000), the_ Pod Listing _will automatically_ Expire_._

Instead of waiting for a _Pod Listing_ to be _Filled_, _Pod_ owners can also sell _Pods_ directly into an outstanding _Pod Order_.
