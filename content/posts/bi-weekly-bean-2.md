# **Protocol Summary**

![Bean Price](/assets/uploads/bw2-bean-price-.png)

Bean price continues to hang tightly to its peg. Demand for Beans is steadily increasing, with over 4 million newly-minted Beans in the past two weeks—a 300% increase over the March 1-15 period.

![Bean Supply](/assets/uploads/bw2-bean-supply.png)

Bean supply reached an all-time high of USD 48.5 M, beating its previous record set in December last year.

This increased demand is also reflected in Beanstalk’s Pod Rate, the ratio of unharvested Pods to total Beans, which has dropped down more than 100%.

![Beanstalk Liquidity](/assets/uploads/bw2-beanstalk-liquidity.png)

Overall protocol liquidity has reached all time high of 28.9 million USD, accelerated by a large influx of liquidity in the Uniswap BEAN:ETH pool.

The Weather continues to trend downwards, with a decrease of more than 400% in the last period—reflecting the high demand for Beans in general and particularly for Soil.
