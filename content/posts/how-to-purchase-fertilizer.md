**[July 20th, 2022] Note: This blog post is not maintained. You can find an up-to-date guide on buying Fertilizer [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/guides/earn-interest-on-beans/buy-fertilizer).**

Beanstalk is hosting the Barn Raise — a fundraiser to restore approximately $77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo — starting on **Monday, June 6 at 4:00pm UTC**. You can find a comprehensive overview of the Barn Raise in [A Farmer’s Guide to the Barn Raise](https://bean.money/blog/a-farmers-guide-to-the-barn-raise).

After Beanstalk is Replanted, Fertilizer will receive a pro rata share of one-third of new Bean mints based on the interest rate, or Humidity. In order to purchase Fertilizer—


1. Head over to the Barn Raise interface at [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/#/).

2. Select either USDC or ETH to purchase Fertilizer. If you select USDC, you’ll have to first Approve the Fertilizer contract to access your USDC. If you select ETH, it will be converted to USDC automatically.
