The past two weeks have seen a series of proposals, here is a summary of them:

* [BFP-73](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x7187da12eb07864d9f82f429feb49ea1cc9342755abe9831e81b294884307d2b): Beanstalk Community Multisig

* [BFP-75](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa3834c289604364a1cb0cddfc6397f89bb66fac673ca82e7869fee7167e92431): Choose BEAN:3CRV for the Replant Liquidity Pool; Set Initial Minting Schedule
* [BFP-76](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xae6e909e82ee6c0ffd0ae266dd9b6e2d07894af62c6ba8de76ef0002489eb2a8): A follow-up to the Replant pool based on the outcome of BFP-75
* [BIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xe47741c4bfa4ac97ad23bbec0db8b9a5f2efc3e1737b309476d90611698193f4): Migration of Balances

BFP-76 is currently being discussed on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/39tEEkgj). BIP-20 is the first BIP to be proposed after the exploit. **BIPs need 50% minimum Stalk voting in favor in order to pass, Stalk holders are encouraged to vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xe47741c4bfa4ac97ad23bbec0db8b9a5f2efc3e1737b309476d90611698193f4).**

The Trail of Bits audit started on June 6 and have asked to extend the audit until the first week of July which is expected to push back the Replant.

Also, the latest episode of The Bean Pod is live. [Listen](https://anchor.fm/thebeanpodpodcast/episodes/Soil-e1juaqu/a-a83unhr) in as Rex and Publius talk about Soil, Beanstalk's willingness to issue debt, and its importance to the protocol's peg maintenance and debt level.
