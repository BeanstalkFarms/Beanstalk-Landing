Beanstalk is a decentralized and transparent solution to DeFi's endemic stablecoin supply shortage. It was designed from first principles to be a paradigm-shifting DeFi primitive that makes decentralized, cost-efficient stablecoins available to anyone with an internet connection.

Beanstalk was initially launched in August 2021 with just 100 Beans and has never taken traditional funding. Over the last eight months, Beanstalk organically grew to $100M in market cap, attracting $144M in long term-incentivized liquidity.

Until the on-chain governance attack on April 17, Beanstalk's [model](https://bean.money/docs/beanstalk.pdf) was working exactly as designed. During the two weeks prior to the attack, the protocol:

-   Paid ~$25M back to creditors, reaching a total of ~$50M paid back since Beanstalk's inception;
-   Distributed ~$25M in interest to Depositors in the Silo;
-   Attracted ~$110M in new liquidity across three liquidity pools; and
-   Reduced the protocol debt ratio by more than 50%.

From Day 1, the protocol has been owned solely by members of the Beanstalk DAO via a decentralized, on-chain governance structure. Unfortunately, a bad actor exploited that very structure to steal all Silo assets, including ~$77M in non-Bean liquidity. **This was an attack on Beanstalk's governance model, not its economic design.**

Despite this hurdle, the Beanstalk community has emerged stronger than ever and contributors are working around the clock and without pay to get the protocol back online. The Beanstalk Farms team has always said that if Bean is at peg, it's a good day. The community is ready to have a great day.

## The Plan

The Beanstalk community has discussed a number of possible paths forward for Beanstalk. Below, Beanstalk Farms outlines what it views as the optimal mechanism to safely Unpause the protocol, with the following four primary goals in mind:

1.  Securing the enduring success of Beanstalk's economic model;
2.  Attracting sufficient capital to restart Beanstalk;
3.  Preserving as much of each Farmers' Stalk, Seed and Pod positions as possible; and
4.  Aligning new capital with previous Stalk and Pod holders.

This plan is subject to change as conversations with the community and various sources of capital continue. Ultimately, the Beanstalk DAO will vote on the final version via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xedd9f9c4d5246b0de0c27dca2b37563baacc667bd5fa1b58b8d85d62c49f3293).

### Fundraiser (The Barn Raise)

#### Overview

Beanstalk will host the Barn Raise, a public ten-day fundraiser to restore up to 100% of the ~$77M of non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo. The Barn Raise will consist of two phases: (1) a seven-day Bidding Period, followed by (2) a three-day Sowing Period. This fundraiser presents a unique opportunity for supporters to access a category-defining protocol at a seed-like stage while stepping into pre-existing product-market fit, a proven team, and a steadfast community. Any Ethereum wallet will be able to lend to Beanstalk during the Barn Raise via the new Barn Raise Pod Line (BR Pod Line).

There will be ~77M Soil available during the Barn Raise, meaning that a maximum of $77M can be Sown before the fundraiser ends. 

Note: Soil is Beanstalk's willingness to issue debt, and Sowing is the act of lending to Beanstalk. Weather is the interest rate for Sowing.

#### Bidding Period

For 7 days, participants will have the option to submit bids for Pods — Beanstalk's native debt asset — using two parameters:

1.  the Weather for Sowing; and
2.  the size of the Bid, denominated in USD.

When Bidding, the assets to be Sown are locked in at the time of submission. Bids will not be cancellable once submitted, but may be updated to lower the Weather.

Bids placed earlier in the Bidding Period will receive a bonus. The bonus for submitting a Bid will start at 21% on Day 1 of the Bidding Period and decrease by 3% per day until the end of the Bidding Period. Updating a Bid resets the bonus. The bonus will be added to the Weather. For example, a $100 Bid with 120% Weather and a 21% bonus would yield 100 + 100 * (1.2 + .21) = 241 Pods.

During the Sowing period, Bids will be auto-filled if and when the Bid's Weather is reached, given there is Soil available. Bids are auto-filled in the order in which they were received, meaning earlier Bids at a given Weather have priority in the BR Pod Line.

Bids placed at or below 20% Weather will automatically be Sown when the Sowing Period begins.

#### Sowing Period

On Day 8 of the Barn Raise, the Sowing Period will begin. The Weather will start at 20% and increase by 1% every 10 minutes for the duration of the Sowing Period, which will end after three days or when Soil reaches 0 -- whichever occurs first.

Participants can Sow at any time during the Sowing Period, so long as there is available Soil. Bids do not have to be placed in order to Sow.

Bids that are not successfully filled during the Sowing Period will be claimable after Beanstalk is Unpaused. Bids will be partially fillable.

#### Beanstalk Restart

After the Sowing Period concludes, there will be a brief interlude prior to Unpausing Beanstalk, during which core contributors and the community will ensure that satisfactory governance and safety measures are in place. Once Beanstalk is Unpaused, new Bean mints will be distributed in a one-third allocation to each of the Silo, the existing Pod Line and the BR Pod Line. The BR Pod Line, like the existing Pod Line, will be repaid on a FIFO basis. After the BR Pod Line completely Harvests, the new Bean mint schedule will revert to Beanstalk's original one-half Silo and one-half existing Pod Line allocation.

Capital Sown during the Barn Raise will be used to recapitalize stolen funds pro rata to the Silo. The protocol will scale its obligations based on the amount of capital raised. This means that if X% of the ~$77M is raised, participants will receive X% of their pre-exploit Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV and Pods.

Silo Members' recapitalized Silo assets will be placed under a vesting schedule based on the percentage of the BR Pod Line that has become Harvestable. If Silo Members choose to Withdraw before the BR Pod Line has been fully repaid, they will face a haircut proportional to the amount of the BR Pod Line repaid. For example, if a Silo Member decides to Withdraw all of their assets from the Silo and 50% of the BR Pod Line has been repaid, they will forfeit their rights to 50% of those assets. Farmable Beans earned from new mints going forward are not subject to this vesting schedule.

This is the current iteration of the Barn Raise opportunity. As discussed above, the community is still evaluating possible adjustments in order to properly incentivize new capital, and is happy to speak with anyone who has additional thoughts, questions or offers on how to safely reseed Beanstalk's liquidity and Unpause the protocol.

#### Governance

Shortly after the April 17 attack, Beanstalk was Paused and on-chain governance was removed. Once Unpaused, Beanstalk will be governed via a new community-run multisig wallet custodied by a group of nine Beanstalk community members and contributors. This will serve as a temporary security measure until a secure and fully-decentralized governance mechanism has been developed and sufficiently audited. BIPs will be voted on via Snapshot until then.

Beanstalk Farms continues to be excited about the potential of on-chain governance within DeFi. However, the team recognizes the current implementation [challenges](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1516248195042615311?s=20&t=I27QJXczW9mcUWLloY39CA) of safe on-chain governance and takes the position that an adequate mechanism should be reinstated only with great caution.

#### Security

Security is paramount to Beanstalk's success and a core focus for Beanstalk Farms. Moving forward, Beanstalk Farms will implement a number of security changes and engage top security audit firms to ensure that Beanstalk remains healthy and safe.

Beanstalk security measures:

-   Beanstalk governance will move off-chain to a Gnosis multisig wallet custodied by Beanstalk Farms and Beanstalk community members;
-   Over the short term, the development team will focus its energy on safely Unpausing Beanstalk and ensuring the integrity of Beanstalk's core functionality. Once complete, Beanstalk Farms will explore a more resilient decentralized governance structure;
-   In early June, Beanstalk will undergo an end-to-end audit with [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/);
-   Beanstalk Farms will launch an ongoing bug bounty program with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) and other leading bug bounty platforms; and
-   Beanstalk Farms is doubling down on its efforts to attract and retain experienced security engineers who specialize in smart contract development.

Barn Raise security measures:
-   The Barn Raise contract will be a separate contract from Beanstalk itself;
-   The Barn Raise contract will be governed by the Gnosis multisig wallet detailed in the Governance section; and
-   The Barn Raise contract will direct funds to the Gnosis multisig wallet detailed in the Governance section. The contract will not custody any funds.

## The Path Forward

Beanstalk has always been an experiment. Contributors recognize a need within DeFi for a capital-efficient, decentralized stablecoin and set out to build it together. Beanstalk's innovative credit facility and incentive mechanisms are responsible for the protocol's growth to $100M in market cap in just eight months.

Unlike every other decentralized credit based stablecoin in history, Beanstalk's economic model has not failed. The Beanstalk Farms team is committed to carrying the torch for Beanstalk's mission in lockstep with the Beanstalk community. We believe that Unpausing Beanstalk after a successful Barn Raise is the best path to achieve that goal.
