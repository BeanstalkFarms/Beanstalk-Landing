Today, Bean Sprout — a recently launched Beanstalk accelerator program — announced a series of Layer3 Bounties as part of its ongoing marketing and community outreach efforts to continue growing Beanstalk’s user base.

Layer3 partners with web3 communities (DAOs) to curate lists of tasks that increase community engagement and promote virality. Anyone with an Ethereum-compatible wallet who completes and wins these tasks is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

This round of Beanstalk Bounties lasts for four weeks, half of which are live from 1/24 - 2/7 and the other half will be live from 2/7 - 2/21. In total, Bean Sprout is offering a total of 7,900 Beans across the 14 tasks, which 36+ winners can earn.

A selection of the 14 Bounties are listed below, with the full selection [available](https://alpha.layer3.xyz/daos/beanstalk) on Layer3:
