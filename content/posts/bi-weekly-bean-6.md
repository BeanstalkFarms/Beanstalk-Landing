As we enter the month of July, Farmers all around are preparing to Replant Beanstalk.

Two Beanstalk Farms Proposals have been proposed and passed:

* [BFP-77](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xbb1db9c60534b7aa3951ea0d7b107f755d555acdd95c495388be7a1bd7f494e0): Choose BEAN:3CRV A Parameter
* [BFP-78](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x4289cde88a6c3c0be830b0b8f39bba3f54258a77947bec0f37b0668e12e530ea): Set Initial Minting Schedule at Replant

BFP-79, a proposal to update various Beanstalk verbiage at the protocol, UI, and documentation level, is currently being discussed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/beanstalk).

Before continuing with the Beanstalk Water Treatment Process in accordance with [BIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xe47741c4bfa4ac97ad23bbec0db8b9a5f2efc3e1737b309476d90611698193f4), all Farmers have the opportunity to verify their allocations of **Non-Deposited Unripe assets**.

Farmers can verify their allocations to ensure no miscalculation occurred during the migration of on-chain data by following [this](https://www.notion.so/Beanstalk-Water-Treatment-Effort-Non-Deposited-Unripe-Assets-164711eab8c243ae9acb128a061837c3) guide.

The Halborn audit is wrapping up and the Trail of Bits audit is expected to end on July 6 with the audit reports published by mid July. The exact date of Replanting Beanstalk will be voted on by the Beanstalk DAO after that.

Two episodes of the The Bean Pod are live:
