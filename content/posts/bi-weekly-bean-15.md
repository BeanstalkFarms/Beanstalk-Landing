> What is Beanstalk? Beanstalk is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Learn more at [bean.money](https://bean.money/).

* [BIP-29](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-29-pod-market-price-functions.md) - Pod Market Price Functions -\*\* passed by a vote of the Beanstalk DAO. BIP-29 improves the composability of Farm balances and implements V2 Pod Orders and Listings, which prices Pods as a function of their place in the Pod Line.
* [Root](https://roottoken.org/),\*\* a permissionless fungible wrapper that enables collective farming for Beanstalk Silo Deposits launched!
* Just in time for 2022 FIFA World Cup, **[Paradox](https://betparadox.com/)** also launched, providing liquid peer-to-peer betting markets utilizing the Root token.
