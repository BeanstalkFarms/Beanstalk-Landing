Mark your calendars, we have a date! On **August 6, 2022 at around 16:00 UTC,** Beanstalk will be Unpaused per BIP-21, the proposal to Replant Beanstalk.

**If you haven’t voted, you can do so [here](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xbe30bc43d7185ef77cd6af0e5c85da7d7c06caad4c0de3a73493ed48eae32d71).**

BIP-21 primarily does three things:

1. Executes a series of transactions to Replant Beanstalk.
2. Commits a series of upgrades to Beanstalk.
3. Unpauses Beanstalk.

*Upon the passing of BIP-21, Humidity will drop from 500% to 250%*. You can read more about the BIP [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/72).

Moreover, the first 4 BFCP-As have been proposed on Snapshot. BFCP-As are proposals to be on the Beanstalk Farms Committee that has discretion over the BF budget, including contributor compensation. The proposals will require a 25% quorum (currently ~53M Stalk) and majority vote For in order to pass. You can read the proposals and vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth). You can also read more about the BFC in [BFP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa24c368f08093b8a5e27c0b3ae9296eb60272cddc8882434b02a86152d903e59), which proposed several updates to the governance structure of Beanstalk Farms.
