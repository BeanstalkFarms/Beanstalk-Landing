Happy Halloween Farmers!

Zombie Bean has arrived on the Farm and has been busy redecorating! Listen to **Beanthoven**'s [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NNOBMjc4Is) and check out the new UI [theme](http://app.bean.money).

The BCM updated Beanstalk to fix a bug in the Pod Market reported by a whitehat on Immunefi last week (no funds were at risk). You can read about EBIP-3 [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/ebip/ebip-3-pod-listing-cancellation.md).

The Beanstalk Community Grant Program has now been live for one quarter. In this [article](https://bean.money/blog/community-grant-program-q3-2022), we recognize the excellent community-produced content that was awarded Beans during Q3 2022.

A beta release of the new Beanstalk analytics website is [live](https://analytics.bean.money/) and the October Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout budget reports are [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Farms-Operations/blob/main/beanstalk-farms/10-2022-report.md) and [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Farms-Operations/blob/main/bean-sprout/10-2022-report.md).
