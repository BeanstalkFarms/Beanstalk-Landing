We’re inching closer to Replant. [Halborn](https://halborn.com/), a blockchain security firm, completed a formal audit of Beanstalk’s smart contracts on July 13, 2022 in accordance with [BFP-66](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x54fad9c756daa38bb4bafadbee2cea6cb98f380fe2d6a62fdf723d0b15430d42).

This is one of two scheduled audits—the other audit with Trail of Bits is expected to wrap-up by the end of July 2022 ahead of replant.
