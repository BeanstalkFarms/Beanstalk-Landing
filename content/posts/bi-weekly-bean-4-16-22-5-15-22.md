Welcome to the Bi-Weekly Bean, a newsletter that recaps the happenings in the Beanstalk ecosystem. This issue will cover the 4/16/22– 5/15/22 period.

> What is Beanstalk? Beanstalk is a decentralized credit-based stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Learn more at bean.money.

As the summer months approach, both old and new farmers are rightfully asking: what's next for Beanstalk?

Since the protocol's governance [exploit](https://bean.money/blog/beanstalk-governance-exploit) on Easter weekend, the community has rallied and devised a plan for the [Barn Raise](https://bean.money/blog/path-forward) to recapitalize the Beanstalk and get it back on its feet. Various proposals have been considered around this idea, and the most recent proposal approved by the Beanstalk DAO offers the latest details:
